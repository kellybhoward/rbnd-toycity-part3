Q: How long did you spend working on this project?
A:  ~ 2 hrs

Q: What was the most rewarding challenge you conquered?
A:  Coming up with new feature ideas.

Q: What two additional features did you build? Why?
A:  (1) Rejecting a purchase
    - Added Reject class (similar to transaction class)
    - Added customer method reject
    - Added increase_stock to product to keep product count up to date
    (Why?) Sometimes customers make mistakes in purchasing items and need to return them

    (2) Timestamps for transactions for bookkeeping
    - adding purchase_timestamp to transaction class
    - adding a display_time method
    (Why?) Timestamps are vital for tracking purchasing history and keeping stats on a customer's shopping habits

Q: Where do you still have room to grow?
A:    Making my code more Ruby style and less using Ruby to code like a Javascript programmer
